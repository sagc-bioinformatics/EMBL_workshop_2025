# GSEA
`gsea_pawsey` has outputs from running my GSEA Rscript in the singularity on Pawsey.

# Loupe Browser
Most of the Loupe Browser outputs are just 10X example sets, so they are available on https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-of-mouse-embryo-4 
We'll use the DEG result exported from Loupe Browser 'loupe_deg/brain_vs_alcohol_DEGall.csv`
